title: Xbox One music hack
---

This is a life hack, but it's a hack and it involves digital computers...  Music cannot be downloaded to the Xbox One, even bought from Microsoft.  The Xbox One has an HDMI input for recieving a signal from a cable box or even an Xbox 360 for a slight form of reverse compatibility.  If you have an Apple TV, you can connect it to the Xbox One HDMI input to access the Apple TV menu from the Xbox.  It still requires the Apple TV remote, but the sound will be broadcast in the Xbox headset.  The problem with this method is that Apple TV does not seem to support playlists, so you will have all of your music playing.
