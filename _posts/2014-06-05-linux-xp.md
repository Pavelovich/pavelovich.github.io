title: Using Linux as a replacement for Windows XP

http://blog.malwarebytes.org/online-security/2014/04/a-penguin-in-xps-clothing/

Malwarebytes wrote an article about how to configure the operation system Linux Mint
to look like Windows XP.  After using this OS and layout in a personal VM, it does
a very good job of emulating the appearance of Windows XP.  There are still some
differences that those of us who remember Windows XP very well will spot as inaccurate,
but they're mostly minor and far between.  The overall appeance of the modification
to the Linux Mint desktop is excellent.

To install the theme, run the following commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons

sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install win-icons

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes

sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install win-xp-theme

You will then need to go to the settings and set the theme options to the Windows XP
emulation pack.
