I am Sasha Pavelovich, a developer and administrator for Lexipedium.org, a free peer reviewed historical wiki.  The projects that I am working on right now are mainly basic and useful Python applications and modules and some work in PHP for MediaWiki.  I have a goal with DondreKhan on working on Android app development.
